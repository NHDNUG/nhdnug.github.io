Have you ever encountered a "possible deference of null reference" in your code and ignored it? How often does application telemetry show Null Reference Exceptions in your production environment? Do you even know what null is?

During this talk we will explore what `null` is, how C# handles it, and some tools and practices to keep you from having failing code in production that can be handled during your development cycles.
