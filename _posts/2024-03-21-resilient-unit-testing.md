"Unit testing and TDD are designed to save time for the developers and testers while also reducing the risk of accidental bugs while implementing change. Yet, most teams either don’t use unit tests or found that they take more time than they save. But this doesn’t have to be your experience, and this session is going to cover the role of a unit test, how to build them to last, and other hidden benefits you can find along the way."

"Come join as we crack open the code and discover a world beyond arrange, act, and assert."
