The Internet of Things (IoT) isn’t just the latest buzzword for vendors to throw around when they talk 
to your boss. It’s also a real opportunity for .NET devs. But IoT devices and platforms are a hot mess. 
Programming for the IoT space is a lot like programming was in 1986, except that everything is connected 
to everything else now.
 
In this session, you’ll learn how to get started with a real-world, end-to-end IoT solution that costs 
five bucks (and an Azure subscription, even a trial one). And how to think about IoT security and avoid 
becoming part of the Incredibly Dangerous Internet of Things (#IDIoT).
