Many F# introductions follow the same pattern: a dutiful introduction to syntax, a few allusions to functional programming, a "Hello World" code sample. I'm not sure these presentations have ever convinced anyone to try F#.

In this talk, I will build (...and break) an application to show off the killer language features that keep me coming back to .NET's *other* language.
