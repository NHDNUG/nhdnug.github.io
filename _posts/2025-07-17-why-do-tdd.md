Developers are not excited to write tests let alone writing them in advance of the code they are going to write. And yet the ability to write the test in advance causes valuable “outside in thinking”:  Consider the class responsibility, consider the API first, and consider the messages to be passed via the API. It also prevents the problem of cutting corners towards the end where maybe those tests don’t get written at all. The design gets a good benefit when starting with tests.

In this talk we'll do some exercises, writing tests in advance and witnessing how doing so improves class design.
