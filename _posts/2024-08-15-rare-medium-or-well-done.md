How would you feel if you ordered a steak expecting it to be cooked to medium but ended up receiving it well done? It sounds like a big missed-steak to me! I mean, steak puns are rarely well done.

In all seriousness, finding the right level of done in software development isn’t as easy as “Rare, medium, or well done?” and we are going to talk about why that is while providing some tools to get it just right.
