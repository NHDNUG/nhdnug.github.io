## Abstract
Software developers are intended to be massive, highly leverageable value creators for their companies and teams - using their creative and technical talent to build products themselves or mission-critical systems that facilitate the delivery of value inside the business.

The blunt truth, however, is that many software developers would screw up tying their own shoes when left to their own devices.

There's an abundant corpus of work out there on how managers routinely let down their software developers through insufficient planning, communication, listening, and support. 

In this talk we're going to explore the inverse - how individual software developers contributing to a project unintentionally sabotage their teams, their companies, their projects, and themselves through:

* Immutable technical preferences + biases;
* Bad attitudes;
* Poor listening;
* Inflexible and unproductive learning styles; 
* Risk aversion;
* Incuriosity;
* And more!

Most importantly, in this talk we're going to try to address how we can help shift developers who want to learn and improve, but are have trouble executing, become the high value contributors they'd like to be.

### Who Is This Talk For?

This talk is for managers of developers, senior developers who want to learn how to effectively mentor or collaborate with other team members who are struggling, and crucially - for JUNIOR developers who don't want to fall into these bad habits before they even get started.
