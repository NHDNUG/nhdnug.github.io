Many of us who use automated tests will use Example Based Tests; these are tests in which we provide data -- the examples that should pass. However there's another less known, but very powerful testing style called Property Based Testing. In this style of testing, we provide properties -- universal invariants that should hold regardless of input. As a result, we no longer specify examples, but let a framework choose examples for us. This gives us a different way to think about our tests and software.

This talk introduces Property Based Testing using FsCheck. FsCheck is a property based testing framework for .NET. While this talk uses F# for most examples, it will provide some examples in C# as well.
