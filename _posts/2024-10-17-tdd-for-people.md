Has this ever happened to you? You're in a meeting, and you and your colleagues just can't seem to get each other. You've shared all the relevant data, and the solution seems obvious to you... But there they go again heading off in some completely esoteric and unintelligible way. Frustrating right? It's a little like what happens when you write some code, only to find it misbehaving in production right?

As developers we solved misbehaving code with Unit Tests. WE adjusted the way we develop so we could get more predictable outcomes. WE invented TDD. What if there was a way to apply to that those confusing and often frustrating conversations with our colleagues? What if we could test our conversations as we make them to get to better results? Let's talk about how we might apply the Ladder of Inference to help us test and verify our conversations and our conclusions as we make them!
