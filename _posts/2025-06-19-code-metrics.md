Code metrics: we’ve seen them in dashboards, status reports, and maybe even used them to win an argument or two. But what do they actually mean—and are they even helpful?

In this light-hearted but informative session, we’ll take a look at a whole grab bag of code metrics, including (but not limited to) Cyclomatic Complexity, Code Coverage %, Maintainability Index, Code Churn, Coupling, Cohesion, and everyone's favorite: Lines. Of. Code.

You’ll learn:
- What these metrics can tell you about your code
- What they absolutely cannot
- How to avoid weaponizing them (intentionally or otherwise)
- When it's okay to say, “Yeah, this number means nothing.”

We’ll bust some myths, share some laughs, and maybe have a little audience participation along the way. If you've ever looked at a sonar report and felt a mix of confusion, curiosity, and existential dread—this talk is for you.

Bring your questions, your skepticism, and your metric horror stories. You’ll leave with a clearer sense of how to use metrics without losing your mind—or your team's trust.
