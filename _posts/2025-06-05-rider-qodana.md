Meet [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), the most productive IDE for cross-platform .NET development. With features like version control integration, local history, database support, and thousands of plugins, Rider boosts your productivity. Now it also includes an AI Assistant to generate code, create unit tests, fix bugs, and explain exceptions or commit messages, allowing you to skip the tedious tasks.

Meanwhile, JetBrains continues to push the boundaries of static code analysis with [Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/), a centralized code quality platform integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Qodana generates detailed reports on code quality and security, making them accessible not only to developers but also to security and compliance teams.

In this talk, we’ll explore Rider’s capabilities alongside Qodana’s role in .NET projects, ensuring you get the most out of your development tools and maintain impeccable code quality. Whether you’re a seasoned user or new to these tools, this session will elevate your workflow.
