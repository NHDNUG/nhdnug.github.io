Come find out what gRPC is, when you should use it, when you shouldn't use it, and how to work around some of it's limitations. Plus, we'll go over how we used it (with .NET) to deliver a microservices architecture at one of the largest Oil & Gas companies in the greater Houston, Texas area to support their trading operations. Plus, you will learn a few ideas that will help make your implementation of gRPC easier!
