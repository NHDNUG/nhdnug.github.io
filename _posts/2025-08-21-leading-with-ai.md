You’ve been building with .NET long enough to know what good code looks like. But leadership isn’t just about writing code—it’s about helping others write it well, too.

In this session, you’ll learn how to use AI to simulate team leadership: think pairing with a junior, refining specs, or documenting your thought process. Whether you lead a team or want to grow into the role, AI gives you a low-stakes way to practice the habits that make great leads.
