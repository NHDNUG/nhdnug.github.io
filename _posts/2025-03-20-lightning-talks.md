We are doing something a little different for our March 2025 meetup: Lightning Talks⚡⚡⚡!

If you have a topic that is .NET or .NET-adjacent (i.e. front-end, testing, architecture, cloud, etc) that you're passionate about but you're not sure you can give a full 45-60 minute presentation then this is your chance - we're going to select 3 Lightning talks that are 15-20 minutes apiece.

If this sounds like fun, please submit our speaker interest form here: [https://forms.gle/aVzeVpvVhAkdfWLy7](https://forms.gle/aVzeVpvVhAkdfWLy7)

## Food / Drinks
Food and drinks will be provided! Please contact us (on meetup) if you have any dietary restrictions/food allergies.

## Directions and Parking Instructions

Meeting will be held in the offices of SmartDraw Software, 1780 Hughes Landing Blvd #1100 on the 11th floor.
