### We are energy. 
For more than 80 years, Southwestern Energy Company has thrived because of a deep commitment to providing the energy that powers our world. Our success continues to be dependent upon the dedication of our employees to the company and to the communities in which we operate.
Currently the third largest producer of natural gas in the US Lower 48, Southwestern Energy Company is a growing independent energy company primarily engaged in natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services.

### We are explorers and producers. 
Every day, our people work to discover innovative new ways to fuel the future. Though we search far beyond our current operating footprint, our work is principally focused on the development of natural gas in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and the exploration of oil and natural gas in other new venture plays in North America.

### We are Midstream Services. 
Our commitment to creating value through innovation is evident in our Midstream Services segment, which primarily supports our E&P operations. Midstream Services generates revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party natural gas.
