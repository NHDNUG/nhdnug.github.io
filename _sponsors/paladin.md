We help company leaders elevate their business performance by providing them
with the talent they need to change and grow.

We quickly realized that business operations needed specialized talent with technical acumen in every area of the
organization. We built out our Engineering and Accounting verticals in order to provide specific talent to Top Firms in
both of these practices.

The need for employees that had expertise to solve clients' pressing problems, and that were able to contribute
immediately, is the driver for our business. We think of ourselves as partners to our clients and that is why
we keep them and place talent in key roles all across enterprises decades after we started doing business with
them. Today, we still remain focused on our customers. And they continue to bring us their most complex and
challenging job requisitions because working with a Paladin maximizes their chance of success and guarantees
that they will receive personal service from a Relationship Manager and company they can Trust.

We primarily focus on Operations like IT, Finance, and Human Resources, but our Recruitment
Specialists dive deeper into specific Functional or Technical areas including Accounting, Applications Development,
or UX design. We hire experienced professional recruiters and continue training them to provide “UP IS US” service
and support their growth as an Employment Expert & Service Champion!
