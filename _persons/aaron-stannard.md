Hi! I'm [Aaron Stannard](https://aaronstannard.com/), and I'm the CEO and founder of <a href="https://petabridge.com/" title="Petabridge - Production-level training and support for Akka.NET">Petabridge</a>, where I'm making <a href="https://getakka.net/" title="Akka.NET - Distributed Actor Model for C# and F#">Akka.NET</a> to help the world's most important companies build amazing applications with .NET.

I've been [working on Akka.NET for over 10 years](https://petabridge.com/blog/10-years-of-akkadotnet/) and I haven't gotten tired of it yet!

Prior to Petabridge I founded MarkedUp Analytics, a real-time in-app marketing and analytics service used by 1000+ developers. Prior to that I worked at Microsoft as a Startup Developer Evangelist.
