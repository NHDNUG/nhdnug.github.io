Claudio is a Technical Director at Improving Houston. He has been developing software since the mid-â€™90s (FoxPro, .NET, Ruby on Rails). When not building software, consulting with clients, doing presentations, delivering training, or hanging out with his family, he can probably be found working on his music or riding his motorcycle.
