Welcome to the repository home for North Houston .NET User Group's website.

We allow contribution to our site... In fact, we encourage it!!!

If you'd like to make a change, please, make a pull request.

There's a couple things you should probably read though - especially if you're developing on Windows:
* [Run Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) - This will get you up and running with the GitHub Pages framework. Very Helpful.
* [Jeckyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) All the info you need to get productive in jekyll
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown Cheatsheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - As nice as MD is, GFM is even nicer. This'll give you the syntax cheats.
* [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) - There are a few minor things that Kramdown makes easier - mostly code blocks. Don't know that they'll ever be needed, but if they are, it's nice to have a link here.

If you at least skim the cheat sheet - and follow along with what's going on in the rest of the source - you should be good to go. If you have any big changes you want to make, just make a pull request. Chances are, it'll be fine!

If you just want to give clone and run it, give it a try! That first site will get all the pre-reqs moving, all you have to do is hit the "servesite.bat" file, and you can see your changes as you make them. Have fun!
