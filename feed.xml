        <title>gRPC + .NET: Lessons from the Trenches</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come find out what gRPC is, when you should use it, when you shouldn’t use it, and how to work around some of it’s limitations. Plus, we’ll go over how we used it (with .NET) to deliver a microservices architecture at one of the largest Oil &amp;amp; Gas companies in the greater Houston, Texas area to support their trading operations. Plus, you will learn a few ideas that will help make your implementation of gRPC easier!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rare, Medium, or Well Done? Finding the right level of DONE in Software Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How would you feel if you ordered a steak expecting it to be cooked to medium but ended up receiving it well done? It sounds like a big missed-steak to me! I mean, steak puns are rarely well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, finding the right level of done in software development isn’t as easy as “Rare, medium, or well done?” and we are going to talk about why that is while providing some tools to get it just right.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High Optionality Programming: Architectural Choices That Mitigate Technical Debt</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“High Optionality Programming” - the practice of paying a small design &amp;amp; programming premium today in order to avoid a massive accumulation of technical debt later. This is a technique we’ve successfully used at large scale in our previous business and in the businesses of many of our customers. The key to implementing high optionality programming correctly is to assess the likelihood of a future change to your system and to plan for its eventuality in advance when it’s cheap to do so: early on in the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we explain the concepts behind high optionality programming, offer some case studies of how it’s been used successfully, and introduce the techniques that actively curb the long-term accumulation of technical debt in software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Property Based Testing in FsCheck</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us who use automated tests will use Example Based Tests; these are tests in which we provide data – the examples that should pass. However there’s another less known, but very powerful testing style called Property Based Testing. In this style of testing, we provide properties – universal invariants that should hold regardless of input. As a result, we no longer specify examples, but let a framework choose examples for us. This gives us a different way to think about our tests and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces Property Based Testing using FsCheck. FsCheck is a property based testing framework for .NET. While this talk uses F# for most examples, it will provide some examples in C# as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Resilient Unit Testing - Going beyond Arrange, Act, Assert</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Unit testing and TDD are designed to save time for the developers and testers while also reducing the risk of accidental bugs while implementing change. Yet, most teams either don’t use unit tests or found that they take more time than they save. But this doesn’t have to be your experience, and this session is going to cover the role of a unit test, how to build them to last, and other hidden benefits you can find along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come join as we crack open the code and discover a world beyond arrange, act, and assert.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Software Developers Destroy Business Value (and What to Do About It)</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software developers are intended to be massive, highly leverageable value creators for their companies and teams - using their creative and technical talent to build products themselves or mission-critical systems that facilitate the delivery of value inside the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blunt truth, however, is that many software developers would screw up tying their own shoes when left to their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an abundant corpus of work out there on how managers routinely let down their software developers through insufficient planning, communication, listening, and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’re going to explore the inverse - how individual software developers contributing to a project unintentionally sabotage their teams, their companies, their projects, and themselves through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immutable technical preferences + biases;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad attitudes;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poor listening;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inflexible and unproductive learning styles;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Risk aversion;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incuriosity;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, in this talk we’re going to try to address how we can help shift developers who want to learn and improve, but are have trouble executing, become the high value contributors they’d like to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-this-talk-for&quot;&gt;Who Is This Talk For?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for managers of developers, senior developers who want to learn how to effectively mentor or collaborate with other team members who are struggling, and crucially - for JUNIOR developers who don’t want to fall into these bad habits before they even get started.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are building desktop apps, mobile apps, or SPAs, nearly every application needs backend APIs. Not only do these APIs need to provide business functionality, but they need to be performant, scalable, and most importantly secure. In this session you will learn the best practices for building APIs in .NET 8 that are being utilized in large scale data sensitive environments today.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Low Ceremony Event Sourcing and CQRS with the Critter Stack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Many people are scared of the potential complexity and difficulty in starting with an Event Sourcing and CQRS technical strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fear not though, the “Critter Stack” is here to provide a very low code ceremony approach to using Event Sourcing as your persistence strategy within a larger CQRS architecture. Using a combination of the Postgresql-backed Marten (https://martendb.io) library for event sourcing and its newer friend Wolverine (https://wolverine.netlify.app) for command handling and asynchronous messaging, I’ll show you how you can quickly get started with both CQRS and Event Sourcing. Once we get past the quick start, I’ll show you how the Critter Stack’s unique approach to the “Decider” pattern will help you create robust command handlers with very little code ceremony while still enjoying easy testability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Moving beyond basic command handling into the realm of “grown up” systems development, we’ll dive into how the critter stack supports effective test automation, built in telemetry, and even manages to provide high performance and scalable systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
