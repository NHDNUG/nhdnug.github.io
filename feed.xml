        <title>Leading from the IDE: How .NET Devs Can Rehearse Leadership with AI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been building with .NET long enough to know what good code looks like. But leadership isn’t just about writing code—it’s about helping others write it well, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you’ll learn how to use AI to simulate team leadership: think pairing with a junior, refining specs, or documenting your thought process. Whether you lead a team or want to grow into the role, AI gives you a low-stakes way to practice the habits that make great leads.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Be Doing Test-Driven-Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers are not excited to write tests let alone writing them in advance of the code they are going to write. And yet the ability to write the test in advance causes valuable “outside in thinking”:  Consider the class responsibility, consider the API first, and consider the messages to be passed via the API. It also prevents the problem of cutting corners towards the end where maybe those tests don’t get written at all. The design gets a good benefit when starting with tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll do some exercises, writing tests in advance and witnessing how doing so improves class design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lines, Lies, and Logic: Making Sense of Code Metrics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Code metrics: we’ve seen them in dashboards, status reports, and maybe even used them to win an argument or two. But what do they actually mean—and are they even helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this light-hearted but informative session, we’ll take a look at a whole grab bag of code metrics, including (but not limited to) Cyclomatic Complexity, Code Coverage %, Maintainability Index, Code Churn, Coupling, Cohesion, and everyone’s favorite: Lines. Of. Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What these metrics can tell you about your code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What they absolutely cannot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to avoid weaponizing them (intentionally or otherwise)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it’s okay to say, “Yeah, this number means nothing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll bust some myths, share some laughs, and maybe have a little audience participation along the way. If you’ve ever looked at a sonar report and felt a mix of confusion, curiosity, and existential dread—this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring your questions, your skepticism, and your metric horror stories. You’ll leave with a clearer sense of how to use metrics without losing your mind—or your team’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Software then and now: a personal journey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my first software company in 1982 and have been an active developer for more than 40 years. What were the challenges back then compared to the present day? How has the business changed? What have I learned that still apply today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;date-change&quot;&gt;Date Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORMALLY, we do the third Thursday of every month - but in order to accommodate our speaker’s schedule we’re doing April 24th instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lightning Talks!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are doing something a little different for our March 2025 meetup: Lightning Talks⚡⚡⚡!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a topic that is .NET or .NET-adjacent (i.e. front-end, testing, architecture, cloud, etc) that you’re passionate about but you’re not sure you can give a full 45-60 minute presentation then this is your chance - we’re going to select 3 Lightning talks that are 15-20 minutes apiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-lightning-talk-lineup&quot;&gt;Our Lightning Talk Lineup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce our speakers for this event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roslyn-powered-standards-automate-team-conventions&quot;&gt;Roslyn-Powered Standards: Automate Team Conventions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Peter Hellmuth, Solution Support Engineer at 3E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to design custom Roslyn analyzers to enforce your team’s coding standards, transforming red squiggles into proactive code reviews that begin before you even commit. Develop quick fixes that allow developers to resolve violations with a single click, improving efficiency and consistency. For non-negotiable rules, integrate analyzers into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early and enforce standards before code merges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level: Introductory and overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Topics: C#, Continuous Delivery, Tooling, Patterns &amp;amp; Best Practices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semantic-search-with-sql-server&quot;&gt;Semantic Search with SQL Server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Travis Plummer, Developer at SmartDraw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to show how we can enhance everyday search with Natural Language Processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level: Intermediate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Topics: C#, Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Null, The Absence of a Reference in C#</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever encountered a “possible deference of null reference” in your code and ignored it? How often does application telemetry show Null Reference Exceptions in your production environment? Do you even know what null is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this talk we will explore what &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is, how C# handles it, and some tools and practices to keep you from having failing code in production that can be handled during your development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introduction to the Actor Model with Akka.NET</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor model is an old computer science concept, originating in 1973 - and it laid dormant is largely a thought experiment for most of its history until the rise of the Internet. Now in the era of cheap, commodity cloud computing the actor model is staging a major comeback across all programming languages and runtimes, both for building distributed systems and for creating reactive mobile or desktop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will introduce the actor model through the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://getakka.net/&quot;&gt;Akka.NET&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular distributed actor model framework in .NET. We’ll talk about what sorts of problems it solves well, when you should use it, and what are some of the adoption costs and overhead involved in using a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getakka.net/&quot;&gt;Akka.NET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Is All of My Data Stored in Parquet? (A Deep Dive into the Data Lake)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Parquet is a data format for efficient storage and retrieval of massive quantities of data that has been popularized by widespread adoption of the “data lake” architecture. The title of this talk is a question I asked of a coworker (a data engineer) in the process of consolidating our reporting and inference models onto a new analytics platform. The short answer, “because Databricks”, didn’t satisfy me. I was accustomed to traditional SQL, executing ad hoc queries from any language or platform I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long answer comes from a months-long investigation into how to read and write Parquet files from my favorite languages (C# and F#) and a growing appreciation of the format’s flexibility. I hope to convey more than just the Parquet specification, but also the ““how”” of parsing and writing Parquet and ““why”” this data format is so popular. I want to spark a discussion on the value of open-source data formats and how to avoid vendor lock-in for data access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TDD for People</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you? You’re in a meeting, and you and your colleagues just can’t seem to get each other. You’ve shared all the relevant data, and the solution seems obvious to you… But there they go again heading off in some completely esoteric and unintelligible way. Frustrating right? It’s a little like what happens when you write some code, only to find it misbehaving in production right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As developers we solved misbehaving code with Unit Tests. WE adjusted the way we develop so we could get more predictable outcomes. WE invented TDD. What if there was a way to apply to that those confusing and often frustrating conversations with our colleagues? What if we could test our conversations as we make them to get to better results? Let’s talk about how we might apply the Ladder of Inference to help us test and verify our conversations and our conclusions as we make them!&lt;/p&gt;
