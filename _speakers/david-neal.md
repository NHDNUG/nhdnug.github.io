I am a father, geek, musician, and software developer living in North GA near Chattanooga, TN. I've spent the last several years building high-performance, scalable social media applications, and I currently work at LeanKit as a Developer Advocate. I served as president of the Nashville .NET User Group for 2012 and 2013. Among other things, I'm passionate about software craftsmanship, music, motorcycling, and bacon. You can find me on Twitter as @reverentgeek.
