I am not a rock star. I am not a mad scientist. I'm not a midnight coder and I'm not the smartest developer you'll ever work with. I'm also not the center of attention (ok, well maybe sometimes I am).
<!--more-->

## I am a developer teammate.
I live in the Austin area and currently work as a Principal Software Engineer for Clear Measure. I focus on sharing my knowledge with those around me and being able to learn from anyone willing to teach. I also do a lot of community speaking. If you are within driving distance of Austin and need a speaker, let me know!
