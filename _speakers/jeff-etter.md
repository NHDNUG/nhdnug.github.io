By day JEff is the IT Manager for a MEP consulting engineering firm located in Houston, Texas. CHP & Associates (CHPA) provides A/C, Power, Lighting, and Plumbing systems design services for the commercial industry. For those not familiar with the industry, we work with Architects to provide blue prints used in the construction of Office buildings, Museums, Schools, Convention Centers, Hotels, and other commercial buildings.

Jeff started his career as an Electrical Designer, creating the Power and Lighting blueprints in CAD. Along the way CHPA decided that every desk needed a computer, and that someone was needed to manage them. By that time Jeff had already established his tech savvy by leading the CAD standardization and training charge, so he was offered the opportunity. As they say, they rest is history...

Starting with VB3 and MS Access Jeff began writing simple utility applications, then Classics ASP pages. It has now blossomed into comprehensive corporate Intranet using C# ASP.NET with AJAX against a replicated MS SQL Server. Line of business engineering applications that he has created are used daily to stream line and standardize the production process.

Jeff regularly attends the North Houston .Net Users Group and continue to learn new technologies.
